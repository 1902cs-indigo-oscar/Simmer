# Code of Conduct

## Daily Process
  * Morning standup discussing
    * Plans for the day
    * Obstacles faced yesterday
    * What was done yesterday
  * Pair program on assigned tasks where needed
  * Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
  * Immediately prior to end of day
    * Make applicable PRs, review each otherâ€™s code and merge into master
    * Regroup and keep each other up to date on current progress

## Team Expectations
  * Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
  * Share the mic
  * Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
  * At least message the group when you change what you are working on

##  Issues
  * If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
    1.  Take 10-15 minute break
    2.  List out the pros / cons
    3.  Vote on it
    4.  If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

  * If you are frustrated
    1.  Take a walk or get some water
    2.  Talk constructively about actionable items
    3.  Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
